# BuffonsNeedles 3D - Unity
Simulation of [Buffon's Needle Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffon%27s_needle_problem) using the [Monte Carlo Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method)

# Running the simulation
This repository contains all the source files and prefabs found in the Unity folder.

# How to use
- The Logic Manager object contains fields to control the simulation. Another field is the $\pi$ approximation.
